# Styling

## CSS variables

The library exposes a list of css variables that are divided in two groups:

- Main colors defined [in the palette section in the design file](https://www.figma.com/file/4lkNIPZD8PyW9uQm7jQHoZ/Components-Personal-area?node-id=3621-15252&t=DtdEKGcwMEmm4vH9-4).\
  They are structured as follows: `--color-{colorName}-{colorShade}`.\
  For example, `--color-accent-500` or `--color-danger-100`.\
  A complete list of the available colors can be found [here](https://github.com/it-incubator/incubator-libs/blob/main/packages/ui-kit/src/styles/_colors.scss).

- Semantic color tokens that are used to define the color of the components.\
  For example, `--color-bg-primary` or `--color-button-bg-secondary-active`. \
  A complete list of the available tokens can be found [here](https://github.com/it-incubator/incubator-libs/blob/main/packages/ui-kit/src/styles/_semantic-color-tokens.scss).

## Components

All components are based on the design file. Most of them accept className and style props to allow for custom styling, but
it is recommended to avoid using them as much as possible. If you need to introduce new variantions of a component, please
consider adding them to the library.\
For more details on specific components, please refer to their documentation.
